                    <p>The task was to design, build and deploy a crowdfunding website. Instead of creating a site that
                        only catered to a particular type of project, I decided it could be useful to make it open to
                        all kinds of projects organised by location (local shires), so users only see the projects
                        happening in their local area.</p>
                    <h4>The Stack</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The API was written in Python using Django Rest Framework</li>
                        <li>The Front End was written using React JS</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>I created a location-based news feed that automatically generates content whenever one of the
                        following activities occured...
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project created</li>
                        <li>Progress update added to an existing project</li>
                        <li>A funding milestone was reached - 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the project goal</li>
                        <li>A project was within five days of it's closing date</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>On the profile page, users can view their pledge history, update their username and bio, and
                        change their location. As this website shows local projects, changing a user's location will
                        change the projects in their news feed and the 'Browse by Category' page.</p>
                    <p>I added a "snoop" button to the news feed which allows users to browse projects by location. This
                        allows them to see open projects posted to locations other than the location they've set in
                        their profile.</p>

                    <p>This was a group project. The task was to create a web app that splits income into different
                        accounts or ‘buckets’ according to designated percentages pre-defined by the user. Every
                        transaction is saved to the user’s transaction history list. Buckets can be added, updated, and
                        deleted by the user, and buckets can have their proportion of the funds further split into child
                        buckets.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A recursive serialiser was used to serve nested JSON with children buckets listed inside the
                            parent bucket object</li>
                        <li>Transaction model has a receipt field which is a JSON field. This allows us to do all the
                            calculations on the front end before the API stores the transaction instance (instead of
                            storing the instance first, running the calculations and sending this info back to front-end
                            to be displayed).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The result of this API design was a faster, more responsive front-end and better experience for
                        the user.</p>
                    <h4>Front-End Features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User can edit all their buckets at once and the app will check that all bucket percentages
                            add to 100% before posting the transaction record to the API</li>
                        <li>User can add icons to buckets to help with quick identification</li>
                        <li>Shows a list of all saved transactions by date - user can view the details of any
                            transaction and delete the record if they choose</li>
                        <li> Menu links change whether user is/isn’t logged in</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Handling Monthly Expenses</h4>
                    <p>Our client needed to be able assign her regular monthly expenses to the relevant buckets. These
                        expenses were then used to calculate the minimum required amount that should be put into each
                        bucket to cover her expenses.</p>
                    <p>Upon entering a value into the income field, the app automatically begins to distribute the money
                        into the buckets and shows a warning message if the amount in the bucket is less than the
                        minimum required amount.</p>

                    <p>The task was to create an iOS13 app to interact with my Crelo crowdfunding API.

                    <p>The app was designed with SwiftUI to mimic the appearance of the mobile version of my Crelo React web app. Keeping the design similar across both apps helped to establish a brand and recognisable theme for Crelo.

                    <p>The task was to create a python program that could process a json file containing weather
                        predictions and historical weather data.</p>
                    <p>Part 1 required us to extract the required predictions, format them to pass the tests, and output
                        the formatted information into a new text file.</p>
                    <p>Part 2 required the program to output graphs of the temperature readings and the incidence of
                        particular weather events from json data containing historical weather measurements.</p>
                    <p>Part 3 was an optional challenge which I chose to complete. It required the program to extract
                        certain data from the json file, format the data and generate graphs and formatted text files.

                    <p>The task was to create this portfolio website to showcase the projects that we complete
                        throughout the SheCodes course. We were required to have a minimum of two pages in our website
                        and to use media queries in this project.</p>
                    <p>I styled the pages using Flexbox and CSS grid. I created a simple menu for mobile-sized screens
                        using JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>For larger screen sizes, I added arrow button icons and used JavaScript to dynamically change the
                        images and text for each project. The script also updates the counter so the user can see which
                        section of the project is currently in view and the number of sections left.</p>
